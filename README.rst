Dungeon Nexus
#############

Rogue-like dungeon crawling adventures await!

One day, dungeons appeared scattered throughout the world. These
dungeons were filled with never-before-seen monsters of all
descriptions. Additionally, many valuable resources spawned inside.
These were ripe for the taking — for those brave enough to put their
very lives at risk!

Soon thereafter, adventuring became a valid career path. Adventurers
came in all kinds, from countries the world over. Some desired fame,
while most desired fortune. Some simply partook in adventuring as a
hobby to see what special skills they might be granted.

Every dungeon is connected to each other via the Dungeon Nexus — a
series of hidden tunnels linking the dungeons like a web. Once
discovered, these tunnels can be used to warp adventurers into another
dungeon at a different location.

Mapping out the Nexus brings great advantages to an adventurer — it
might offer the only practical means for many adventurers to access
dungeons in other parts of the world — but it also brings great risk!
One might be warped do a more difficult dungeon, and potentially quite
deep within.

Go forth, either solo or by forming a party with adventurers you meet
along the way. Discover your true potential, and unlock the secrets of
the Dungeon Nexus.
